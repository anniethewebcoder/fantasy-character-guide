          For many people, fantasy is synonymous with RPGs. thanks to
          dungeon-crawling sword and sorcery popularized by Dungeons & Dragons.
          Fantasy focuses on heroic travelers from different backgrounds
          questing for wealth, glory, and righteousness by exploring the world,
          battling monsters and hostile kingdoms, and growing in power as they
          go. These worlds are home to elves, dwarves, and dragons -- drawing
          influence from mythology and foundational fiction like The Lord of the
          Rings and Conan the Barbarian.

          Fantasy has countless variations. Primary-world fantasy incorporates
          fantastic elements like magic, monsters, and nonhuman civilizations
          into the real world; secondary-world fantasy creates an entirely
          fictional world unrelated to the earth or its history. Some fantasy
          focuses on speculative exploration of how the fantastic might change
          the way people live, while others use tropes to explore new mythology.
          There are dozens (if not hundreds) of subgenres that influence what
          "fantasy" means.

          protagonists. However, exploration and growth are popular themes in
          most types of fantasy. To get you started, here are questions to help
