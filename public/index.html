            For many people, fantasy is synonymous with RPGs. thanks to
            dungeon-crawling sword and sorcery popularized by Dungeons &
            Dragons. Fantasy focuses on heroic travelers from different
            backgrounds questing for wealth, glory, and righteousness by
            exploring the world, battling monsters and hostile kingdoms, and
            growing in power as they go. These worlds are home to elves,
            dwarves, and dragons -- drawing influence from mythology and
            foundational fiction like The Lord of the Rings and Conan the
            Barbarian.

            Fantasy has countless variations. Primary-world fantasy incorporates
            fantastic elements like magic, monsters, and nonhuman civilizations
            into the real world; secondary-world fantasy creates an entirely
            fictional world unrelated to the earth or its history. Some fantasy
            focuses on speculative exploration of how the fantastic might change
            the way people live, while others use tropes to explore new
            mythology. There are dozens (if not hundreds) of subgenres that
            influence what "fantasy" means.

            For that reason, it is difficult to make generalizations about
            fantasy protagonists. However, exploration and growth are popular
            themes in most types of fantasy. To get you started, here are
            questions to help you develop goals, beliefs, strengths, and
            challenges for your fantasy hero.
